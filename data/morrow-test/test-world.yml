        Upon closer examination, this chest is nothing more that a poorly made
        apple box, all rough and unaged wood, held together by bands of metal
        and a handful of bent nails.

        blow.  His eyes, downcast and lined with concern, dart about the
        room, never lighting on anything for more than a moment.
