        Shoulders hunched, and back bent, this man stands as
        though the world has beaten him, and he is bracing for the next
        blow.  His eyes, downcast and lined with concern, dart about the
        room, never lighting on anything for more than a moment.

      short: The Testing Room
      desc: |
        A horrific room where all manner of gruesome experiments are conducted
        against hapless, helpess, and hopeless victims.  Oddly, this room is
        not yet covered in blood.

        This room is oddly serene, despite the bits of gore that have been
        tracked in from the west.  Oh look, there's a ficus!
