# Script
#
# module for securely running scripts
#
# This class takes ruby code, verifies that it falls within the subset of what
# we deem as safe code, and runs it.
#
# We take an explicit whitelist approach to all of the code in the script.
# Starting with parsing the ruby code into an AST, we only allow the following:
#   * use of basic datatypes:
#     * Integer, Float, String, Array, Hash, Symbol, Range
#   * assignment to local variables
#   * flow control (if/elsif/else, unless, while, case, until)
#   * logical conditions (or, and, and not)
#   * white-list based method calls
#
# Some things that are not permitted:
#   * accessing any Constant
#   * defining classes, modules, methods
#
# There are three whitelists that dictate what the script can run.  You can
# read more about each one at their definitions.
#   NodeTypeWhitelist: Parser::AST::Node types that are permitted in the source
#   InstanceMethodWhitelist: methods that may be called on instances
#   Sandbox::ScriptMethods: any other methods that may be called (no instance)
#

  #
  # This is the list of Parser::AST::Node types that are permitted within the

  # subset needed to provide a functional scripting facility.
  #
  #                           *** IMPORTANT ***
  # Have a good reason to modify this list, and verify that all the tests pass
  # before releasing changes.  This limited subset of functionality provides
  # half the security for scripts.

  # InstanceMethodWhitelist
  #
  # This is the list of methods a script may call on **any** instance it has
  # access to.  This list must be kept as small as possible to reduce the
  # attack surface.
  #
  # Before you add anything to this list:
  #   * Be absolutely certain it is needed
  #   * Verify that the added method does not have unintended side-effects on
  #     other instances
  #     * Look at the added method for each of the base types permitted:
  #       * Array, Hash, String, Integer, Float, Symbol, Range, true, false,
  #         and nil
  #       * Make sure none of them provide access to `eval` or `send`
  #       * Make sure none of them allow Strings to be converted to code
  #     * Look at **EVERY** type returned from every method in Script::Sandbox
  #       for the same things
  #       * Note that most methods are pulled from World::ScriptSafeHelpers
  #   * After doing all of that, be certain you actually need the function
  #
  # DO NOT MODIFY this list if you're not comfortable stating that your change
  # **cannot** be used to remotely execute code on the server.
