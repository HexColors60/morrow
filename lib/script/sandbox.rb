# Sandbox
#
# Sandbox in which scripts get evaluated.  All methods in the ScriptMethods
# array are available for the script to use.
module Script::Sandbox

  # ScriptMethods
  #
  # This is the list of methods the script is allowed to call in the sandbox.
  # There is a second list of instance methods the script may call in
  # Script::InstanceMethodWhitelist.
  #
  # Be **extremely** careful about what methods you add to the sandbox.
  # Methods you add **may** be used to remotely exploit the server.
  # DO NOT MODIFY this sandbox if you do not understand how a new method could
  # result in security compromise.
  #
  # If you do modify this, be sure you run the test cases before committing.
  # There are some generic tests in there to detect blatantly bad additions,
  # BUT IN NO WAY IS IT COMPLETE.
  #
  # First things in this list are actually variables we get when the script is
  # run.  We act like they're methods so that Script#safe! doesn't think
  # they're unauthorized methods.
